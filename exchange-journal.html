        <h2>My Exchange Experiences</h2>
        <p>I got a change to study in the U.S. as an exchange student in 2023-24 school year.</p>
        <p>I could not stress just how astonishing it was! I feel like I've done more things in the exchange year more than my entire life, programming and driving robots in the robotics, debating in Model UN, and even doing science fair! Stepping out of my comfort zone and embarking this exchange year has given me life-changing opportunities and therefore made me grow as a person in every aspect.

        <p>More than my personal stories, I even got chances to become a Returnee Ambassador after the exchange year, helping the next-gen get ready for their journeys and sharing my experience and making this exchange student community better.</p>
            
        <p>This high-school exchange year program simply provides people with a chance to transform their worldviews and become a better version of ourselves! I highly recommend high school students to give it a try!</p>
